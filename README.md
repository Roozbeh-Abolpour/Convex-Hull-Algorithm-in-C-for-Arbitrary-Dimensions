# Convex Hull Algorithm in C for Arbitrary Dimensions

This project implements a safe and efficient convex hull construction algorithm in pure C, based on the Quickhull method.  
It supports point clouds in **arbitrary dimensions**.

## Features
- Supports n-dimensional point sets (2D, 3D, ...).
- Based on the Quickhull algorithm (Barber et al., 1996).
- Custom lightweight matrix library (MatLib).
- Incremental convex hull construction.
- Memory-safe and well-structured.

## Build

```bash
make
